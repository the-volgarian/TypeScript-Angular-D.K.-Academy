# Introduction

### What is Angular?
Angular is an open-source framework written in **TypeScript**.

### What does Angular give us?
Angular provides us with ready-to-use features such as:
- **Automation in writing**: Streamlines the development process.
- **Navigation**: Simplifies routing and navigation within applications.
- **Panels with tools**: Built-in tools for development, debugging, and testing.
- **Animations**: Helps in creating smooth transitions and interactive user interfaces.
- And much more...

### The most popular features Angular gives us:
- **Data binding**: Automatically reflects changes in the UI when the underlying data changes. Without this framework, this would need to be done manually (e.g., using AJAX).
- **Router**: Used to navigate through pages, which is essential for Single Page Applications (SPA).
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: A technique to inject dependencies into components or classes during the app's creation.
- **Scoping hierarchy**: Angular supports various levels of scope:
  - **App-level scope**
  - **Module-level scope**
  - **Component-level scope**
  - **Child Component-level scope**
- **Data Flow**: Angular uses a unidirectional data flow that ensures a predictable state management system.

### What is MVC?
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Angular follows this pattern, providing an easy way to add new features, maintain the application, and perform testing.
