# Practical Programming with TypeScript and Angular 🚀

This repo contains my work while studying a practical programming book that helps me master **TypeScript** and **Angular** 📚. Through the practical application of concepts from the book, I create small projects and apps with Angular and TypeScript, using **Git** for version control and tracking my progress 🔄.

## Key Technologies:

- **TypeScript** 📝 – used for typing JavaScript and working with objects and classes.
- **Angular** ⚙️ – building web applications with a component-based architecture.
- **Git** 🧑‍💻 – version control and syncing code across different devices and repositories.

Each new chapter or section from the book I read is followed by the implementation of the corresponding concepts in a new directory with code. I use Git to save my progress and track changes in the code 📈.
